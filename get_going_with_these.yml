words you might not know that im gonna say a lot:
  trustless: the ability to transact value without having to trust the counterparty
  layer1: a blockchain's native software stack
  layer2: any software built "on top of" a layer1 protocol.  usually in order to handle some operation the layer1
    is lackluster at.
  dex: decentralized exchange
  cex (SEX): centralized exchange
  dapp: Decentralized Application
  coin: the basic unit of value a layer 1 blockchain supports
    examples:
    - Bitcoin: (BTC)
    - Ethereum: (ETH)
    - Cosmos: (ATOM)
  token: an abstraction around ... whatever ... that provides a common interface to faciltate
      for operations like atomic swaps to occur on the layer 1.  This is is not a coin.  Mai
